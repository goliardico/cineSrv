# cineSrv

Node.js + Express backend for cineApp android app.

First release in December 2013, still works!
Just a few fixes in February 2016 for migration process from Nodejitsu (dead) to Heroku

It's scrape the web (with Cheerio) to find movies in italian theatres, returns a jsonp with many information and schedules.
